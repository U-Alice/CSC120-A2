What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

While working on this assignment, I got struggled a bit making sure that indentation is right. Also since python is loosely and dynamically typed, some errors do not show up until you run the program. I spent time debugging an error on a line where I was calling refurbish method, only to find out that I had forgotten 'self' while declaring the constructor. To the person taking this course in the future, I would encourage them to use more resources outside of class to really learn the syntax and not to stress when things are not working right away because it's usually a small issue that is solved with patience review of the codes like in my case.
